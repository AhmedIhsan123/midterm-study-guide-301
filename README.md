# midterm-study-guide-301

Below are possible starter questions for the midterm. You will be randomly assigned a question at the start of the exam. If you finish a question before time expires, you will be asked the time complexity of your solution and given another question of similar difficulty. If you finish the second question, you will be given a third, harder question The list of second and third questions will not be disclosed. To pass the exam with a 75% or higher, you must complete the first question and make some progress into the second.

In the actual exam, we will not execute your code; the syntax does not need to be 100% perfect but you should still show strong Java proficiency.

## Study Guide Task
Implement each of the below starter questions AND make tests for each one.

For each method you are only required to implement it for one of the data structures. But use a different data structure for each method. For example, do maxDiff with an array, the next question with a Set, etc.

## Starter Questions:

Find the difference between the largest and smallest integer in:
- An array
- An ArrayList
- A HashSet
- The values of a HashMap
- The keys of a HashMap

Find the longest word that starts with a specific character letter in:
- An array
- An ArrayList
- A HashSet
- The values of a HashMap
- The keys of a HashMap

Count how many words are longer than n characters and shorter than m characters in:
- An array
- An ArrayList
- A HashSet
- The values of a HashMap
- The keys of a HashMap

Find the difference between the how many odd and even numbers there are in:
- An array
- An ArrayList
- A HashSet
- The values of a HashMap
- The keys of a HashMap

Find the second-largest number in:
- An array
- An ArrayList
- A HashSet
- The values of a HashMap
- The keys of a HashMap
